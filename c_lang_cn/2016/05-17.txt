21:06 linearain: i hate money too
21:07 linearain: the root of all evil
21:07 lh_mouse: wow, you hate money? please, please give'em to me. XD
21:07 linearain: dont you think money is strange?
21:08 lh_mouse: yes and no. XD
21:08 linearain: i am happy if i have just enough for food and rent, yet there are people with millions and billions
21:08 linearain: what the fuck they do with that money
21:09 lh_mouse: Trump?
21:09 linearain: probably
21:09 * lh_mouse wishes he had a lot of money.
21:10 linearain: do you have mastercard or visa in china?
21:10 lh_mouse: no.
21:10 linearain: really?
21:11 lh_mouse: neither of them, and neither do I have any other kinds of credit cards.
21:12 linearain: you dont use bank at all?
21:12 linearain: anyway
21:12 lh_mouse: a debit card isn't a credit card.
21:12 linearain: yeah
21:12 lh_mouse: I have a few debit cards.
21:12 linearain: i have special card for ebay and stuff
21:12 lh_mouse: But I am not willing to use credit cards.
21:13 lh_mouse: it is a bit hard to describe my opinion upon them... they are legal swindles by bankers? sort of.
21:14 linearain: swindles?
21:14 lh_mouse: yes.
21:14 linearain: once upon a time in china...
21:14 linearain: there are english words i never use :D
21:15 lh_mouse: 'swindle'?
21:15 linearain: yeah
21:15 linearain: and upon
21:15 lh_mouse: /w\
21:16 linearain: are you good at C or C++?
21:16 lh_mouse: meh.  'my opinion on sth.' or 'my opinion upon sth.'
21:16 lh_mouse: both. at least I believe so.
21:16 linearain: which you learnt first?
21:16 lh_mouse: C 
21:16 linearain: im learning c++ first for some reason
21:17 linearain: is c very different?
21:17 lh_mouse: It isn't a bad thing for people.
21:17 lh_mouse: Yes it is.
21:17 lh_mouse: C is much more terrible.
21:17 linearain: i heard its better
21:17 linearain: opinions opinions
21:18 linearain: onions
21:18 linearain: tears
21:18 lh_mouse: C requires less mentality.
21:18 linearain: lol
21:18 lh_mouse: It is as simple as that.
21:18 linearain: thats a good thing
21:19 linearain: i still dont know what struct is and classes etc lol
21:19 lh_mouse: C++ enables people to make the compiler do things for them, so they can do less.
21:19 linearain: linux kernel is all C right?
21:19 lh_mouse: C code is usually longer and more messy.
21:19 lh_mouse: yes.
21:20 lh_mouse: It has been in C since 1991.
21:20 linearain: and some assembler
21:20 linearain: so c is faster and more reliable
21:20 lh_mouse: C isn't necessarily faster.
21:21 lh_mouse: And C is fragile.
21:21 linearain: did you try to write 3d games?
21:21 linearain: fragile in what way?
21:21 lh_mouse: no. I am a server developer.
21:22 linearain: networking god?
21:22 lh_mouse: C is more subject to memory leaks etc.
21:22 lh_mouse: With C++ we have smart pointers.
21:22 linearain: arent memory leaks caused by bad programming?
21:22 linearain: you mean lost memory addresses?
21:23 lh_mouse: C++ has so many libraries that we don't need to build everything from skeleton.
21:23 lh_mouse: not necessarily bad but careless people.
21:24 linearain: so c++ enables careless people to get away with bad programming lol
21:24 linearain: its ridiculous, programs are so slow nowadays
21:25 lh_mouse: bad people are always bad no matter what programming languages they use.
21:25 linearain: yeah but with C they wont even finish the program
21:25 linearain: no program better than a shit program :D
21:26 lh_mouse: C hopes people to write everything explicitly.
21:26 lh_mouse: reusability is the key.
21:26 linearain: portability?
21:26 lh_mouse: vector<string>, vector<int>, vector<vector<int>>, etc.
21:27 Stevearzh quit:Quit: Quit...

21:31 linearain: lets say i have a multiplayer game and i want both european and chinese players play in a single server with equal latency, would it be possible to have a proxy server in china and somehow tunnel it directly with the main server in europe?
21:31 lh_mouse: you usually don't need a proxy.
21:32 linearain: but i mean for the sake of latency
21:32 linearain: usually a chinese player would have like 1000ms latency
21:32 linearain: i would need at least 100-200
21:32 linearain: they would connect to the proxy server rather than to the main server
21:33 lh_mouse: yes you need a proxy but it has to be carefully selected.
21:33 lh_mouse: Amazon is about to set up a proxy cluster in Guangdong iirc.
21:34 linearain: that would give less latency?
21:35 lh_mouse: network traffic would have to go from Guangdong to Hong Kong, then to other countries.
21:36 lh_mouse: It is a direct line from inside China to outside, but it is still subject to the GFW.
21:36 lh_mouse: It can reduce the latency to about 80, but is also very expensive.
21:37 lh_mouse: ￥600/1Mibps iirc.
21:37 lh_mouse: (permonth)
21:37 linearain: 600 yuan is how much LD
21:38 lh_mouse: About 81 Euro.

22:08 iyzsong: yeah! according to wikipedia,  from L.L. Zamenhof.  
22:09 linearain: whats wrong with english?
22:11 linearain: some stuff about c++ i dont get...
22:11 linearain: how the sizeof operator knows the size of an array?
22:12 iyzsong: they say natural languages (English, etc) are complex and require more efforts to learn than well-designed constructed one like Esperanto (eg: all nouns are end with 'o').
22:12 linearain: english seems simple to me
22:13 iyzsong: linearain: compiler can know it by read your code.

22:17 linearain: anyone have a good chinese movie for me?...
