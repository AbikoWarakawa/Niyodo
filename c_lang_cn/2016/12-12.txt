11:27 linearain: hi
11:27 linearain: does anyone here use thunder download?
11:40 Javiy: linearain: used to
11:41 linearain: Javiy, i just need one tiny file from it but im on linux
11:41 linearain: and i cant read chinese
11:41 linearain: Javiy, why you dont use it anymore?
11:41 Javiy: Full of ads
11:42 Javiy: Sexy ads,
11:42 Javiy: Gaming ads
11:42 Javiy: Ridiculous ads
11:43 linearain: yeah like torrent sites too
11:43 linearain: but is it safe?
11:43 linearain: no backdoors/viruses?
11:43 Javiy: Yes
11:44 linearain: another reason to learn chinese :D
11:44 linearain: wondering what to learn chinese or japanese
11:44 linearain: since i regret starting from c++ rather than c, i guess starting from chinese is smarter as well
11:46 Javiy: My school's network just like a shit,so I can't download things
11:47 linearain: you live in a school?
11:48 Javiy: I'm not good at programming
11:48 Javiy: I'm a pharmacy student
11:48 Javiy: Full of tears with chemistry
11:49 linearain: oh
11:49 linearain: is there any TCM?
11:49 Javiy: Yes
11:51 linearain: i like tcm
11:51 linearain: western medicine is a joke
11:51 linearain: im also not good at programming, just know a bit of c++
11:52 Javiy: I just know a bit about keyboard and mouse XD
11:53 Javiy: Just how to use it
11:53 linearain: really?
11:54 linearain: good
11:54 linearain: do u know C?
11:56 Javiy: Just know
11:56 Javiy: Where are you from?
11:56 linearain: lithuania
11:57 linearain: and you
11:57 Javiy: China
11:57 linearain: what city?
11:58 Javiy: Dalian
11:58 linearain: oh
11:58 Javiy: Northeast of china
11:58 linearain: i know a movie shot in dalian
11:58 Javiy: Close to Vladivostok
11:58 Javiy: Which one?
11:58 linearain: happy times by zhang yimou
11:59 linearain: i want to visit dalian
11:59 linearain: and other cities
11:59 Javiy: Just come
12:00 linearain: i will...
12:00 Javiy: I'll take you to big sword
12:00 linearain: what is that?
12:00 linearain: monument? bar?
12:00 linearain: tower cafe?
12:00 Javiy: Just a joke in Chinese
12:00 linearain: lol
12:00 linearain: oh
12:00 linearain: right
12:01 iyzsong-xx: 2333
12:01 Javiy: Big sword pronounced like ...you know
12:02 Javiy: iyzsong-xx: 2333
12:02 * iyzsong-xx go for lunch
12:02 linearain: i think dalian is similar to my country
12:02 linearain: in looks
12:02 linearain: because my country is post-soviet
12:03 linearain: Javiy, maybe you want to practice english
12:04 linearain: if i come
12:04 linearain: or chinese
12:04 linearain: or lithuanian lol
12:05 Javiy: My English is really bad
12:06 linearain: my isnt great either
12:06 linearain: but you write very well
12:06 Javiy: But I'm not afraid of saying it.haha
12:06 linearain: do you ever meet english speakers?
12:06 linearain: in dalian
12:06 Javiy: Nope
12:06 linearain: no tourists?
12:07 Javiy: My school is so rural
12:08 Javiy: Maybe not belong to Dalian haha
12:08 linearain: so dalian is close to russia and north korea?
12:08 linearain: did you ever go to other cities?
12:09 Javiy: Shenyang Vladivostok Beijing just a few
12:09 linearain: you can speak russian?
12:10 Javiy: Nope
12:10 Javiy: Just a trip
12:10 Javiy: Like a fool with body language
12:10 linearain: my country has 3 million people
12:10 linearain: china is huge compared to my country
12:11 Javiy: We have a lot of people really really
12:13 linearain: awesome
12:13 linearain: are u interested in music?
12:14 Javiy: Yep
12:14 linearain: rock?
12:14 Javiy: I love hardwell
12:14 linearain: whats that?
12:14 Javiy: Edm
12:14 linearain: can you access youtube?
12:14 Javiy: Electronic dance music?
12:14 linearain: oh i see
12:14 Javiy: Or electric?
12:15 linearain: electrnic heroin
12:15 linearain: can u access youtube?
12:15 Javiy: Yep
12:15 Javiy: By an unusual way
12:16 linearain: can u do it now?
12:16 Javiy: Yep
12:16 linearain: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1kpTkkWVGw
12:16 linearain: a chinese song
12:16 linearain: rock
12:17 linearain: if you have headphones listen :D
12:17 Javiy: Yep
12:18 linearain: i like such music
12:19 Javiy: They look cool..
12:19 linearain: its called visual rock
12:19 linearain: was very popular in japan in 90s
12:20 Javiy: Wow
12:20 linearain: thats what i wonder... if there is more music like this in china
12:23 Javiy: Nowadays Chinese musicians and actors are always in a low level. If you have a beautiful face or sexy body with big boobs , it must be good for your career
12:24 linearain: chinese movies are my favorite but older usually
12:24 Javiy: They are not considering making the music and the movies
12:24 Javiy: Me too
12:24 Javiy: Old ones really good
12:24 linearain: not very old
12:24 linearain: 90s
12:25 Javiy: Yep
12:25 linearain: you know suzhou river?
12:25 Javiy: Yep
12:25 linearain: cool movie
12:25 linearain: the movie is called suzhou he
12:25 linearain: you seen it?
12:25 linearain: btw you liked the song?
12:25 Javiy: Movie?
12:25 linearain: yes
12:26 Javiy: I know the river
12:26 linearain: there is a good movie 
12:26 linearain: "suzhou he" 2001 or something
12:28 Javiy: Yep
12:28 Javiy: I'm going to lunch
12:28 Javiy: Maybe next time
12:28 Javiy: Welcome to China

21:48 cleamoon: orz
21:48 cleamoon: 羡慕嫉妒恨
21:49 Matsune: 京都是个不错的地方
21:49 Matsune: 就是农村了点
21:50 iyzsong: _(:з」∠)_
21:50 cleamoon: 吃的好吗
21:51 Matsune: 不好
21:51 Matsune: 论吃哪能比得上天朝。。。
21:52 cleamoon: .....
21:52 cleamoon: 拉面我觉得还好呀
21:54 Matsune: 拉面贵呀
21:54 Matsune: 奢侈品
21:54 cleamoon: ......
21:55 cleamoon: 那你平常吃什么，方便面全餐？
21:55 Matsune: 吉野家！
21:55 Matsune: 松屋！
21:55 Matsune: 周末自己做
21:57 cleamoon: 天朝一般是吉野家比面馆贵....
21:58 cleamoon: 留学几年成为了人妻音
21:59 Matsune: 最近跟教授讨论以后做什么方向来着
22:01 Matsune: 我说我对NPC问题感兴趣 可以的话做这方面的算法研究 刚好研究室有个马来西亚博士做的是TSP的精确算法
22:01 Matsune: 我就说我也想做这个
22:02 cleamoon: TSP？
22:02 iyzsong: 然后呢！
22:03 Matsune: 然后教授来了句 精确算法屁用没有 而且基本没啥可做的了
22:03 cleamoon: ......
22:03 cleamooon joined channel
22:04 Matsune: 他说 我建议去做近似算法
22:04 cleamoon: 来做离散非线性优化吧
22:05 Matsune: 我最近发现NPC问题简直是个大坑
22:06 Matsune: 离散非线性优化有啥问题急需解决？
22:09 cleamoon quit:Ping timeout: 265 seconds
22:10 cleamooon: 不知道, 不过感觉离散非线性似乎可能没什么解决了
22:11 Matsune: 啥是离散非线性最优化。。。代表问题是啥
22:13 cleamooon: 代表问题不知道, 有个有解的基础问题: optimize a_i*x_i2 s.t. sum x_i = something
22:14 Matsune: 最优化的研究室 在我们楼下。。。
22:16 cleamooon: 你们不也是最优化吗……
22:17 Matsune: 有那么一点不同 你这个问题 就是楼下做的
22:17 cleamooon: 如果是离散的是不是就是你们做的了?
22:17 Matsune: 我们的确是做离散最优化
22:18 Matsune: 但是偏图论问题
22:19 cleamooon: soga
22:21 Matsune: 现在研究室里面不读博的 很多都做化学图的问题
22:21 cleamooon: 于是你以后做什么
22:21 cleamooon: 化学?
22:21 Matsune: NP难问题的近似算法呀。。。
22:22 cleamooon: 教授不是说没意思吗……
22:22 Matsune: 他说精确算法没意思啊
22:22 cleamooon: soga
22:23 Matsune: 关于TSP问题 目前世界上最好的精确算法就是教授弄的。。。
22:23 cleamooon: 听起来蛮orz的
22:23 Matsune: 然后他跟我说 这东西没啥意思了
22:23 cleamooon: orz
22:23 Matsune: 这我肯定信的 那应该是没啥意思了
22:23 iyzsong: _(:з」∠)_
22:24 Matsune: 精确算法的设计 离不开什么DP啊 分治之类的思想
22:24 Matsune: 然后大都是因为无从了解如何确定子问题 只能穷举
22:25 cleamooon: orz
22:25 cleamooon: 理论证明无法确定还是想不出来?
22:26 Matsune: 因为P\NP猜想无从解决呀
22:26 FrankHB: 于是你想拉斯维加斯还是蒙特卡罗跳大绳？
22:26 Matsune: 他们设计算法都是先假定P！=NP
22:27 cleamooon: ……
22:27 Matsune: 我现在还没确定具体做啥问题 然后教授给了我四本书 说好好看好好学
22:28 cleamooon: 然后看了4年
22:29 Matsune: 研究室唯一的女生
22:30 Matsune: 是做图描画的
22:31 cleamooon: 那是什么……
22:32 Matsune: 大概是把一个图画在平面上有几个交点之类的
22:33 Matsune: 那女生很强啊 研究室的其他人都赞不绝口
22:34 cleamooon: 推了然后让她写论文
22:36 Matsune: 最近好像吃鸭脖子
22:37 cleamooon: 小时候去的时候鸭脖子刚刚开始要钱
22:38 Matsune: 日本的东西 没有辣味
22:39 iyzsong: 芥末凑合吧...
22:39 Matsune: 芥末超难吃啊
22:40 Matsune: 我现在特别特别想吃卤菜
22:40 cleamooon: 木须肉之类的?
22:40 cleamooon: 去中餐馆呗
22:40 Matsune: 学校周围的中餐馆
22:41 Matsune: 青椒肉丝 木有辣味
22:41 cleamooon: 青椒肉丝应该是微辣吧
22:42 Matsune: 店名居然叫做四川料理
22:42 cleamooon: 噗
