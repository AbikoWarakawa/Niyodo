12:06 Dove: that'll be very good.
12:06 linearain: do you know some medicine for sleep? :(
12:07 Dove: I don't believe in medicine

12:07 linearain: my only medicine is green tea
12:07 Dove: no 
12:08 linearain: why u dont like tcm?
12:08 linearain: traditional chinese medicine
12:08 Dove: I don't really believe in medicine
12:08 linearain: dont you like tea?
12:09 StardustX: Green tea is bad for sleep
12:09 Dove: I like tea
12:09 StardustX: I never drink it at night
12:09 linearain: yeah i know
12:09 linearain: but its great to relax stress at day
12:10 Dove: don't drink too much tea
12:10 linearain: i need to get away
12:10 linearain: can i come to china?
12:10 Dove: sure

12:12 linearain: ni hao ma?
12:12 Dove: fine
12:13 linearain: i want to either live in china or japan
12:13 Dove: But I don't think it's a good idea to come to China
12:13 linearain: why? everything i have is already from china :D
12:14 Dove: there's too much stress to live in China or Japan.
12:14 linearain: china is big im sure it has remote quiet places
12:14 linearain: but i like action, streets full of life
12:14 linearain: nightlife
12:15 Dove: so u can't sleep
12:15 linearain: i can if i wait until day
12:15 linearain: i cant fall asleep at night...
12:15 linearain: dont know why
12:15 Dove: you'd better find some inner peace
12:16 linearain: these fucking cars are so noisy i need to stuff my ears with something
12:17 Dove: And u don't have to sleep, that's OK.
12:17 linearain: im already losing my sanity
12:18 linearain: my memory, my dreams

12:19 linearain: the only cure
12:20 Dove: yes, I do have some mental problems, but I sleep a lot now.
12:20 linearain: so you would turn in bed awake?
12:20 StardustX: linearain: You may consider replace your window for a soundproof one, and keep every electronic device shutdown
12:20 linearain: yeah i have a router but its not wireless...
12:21 Dove: sleep in important, that's for sure.
12:21 linearain: and i dont have energy to replace the fucking window
12:21 linearain: or money
12:21 Dove: so how can u come to China

12:26 Dove: i can feel agony from u
12:26 linearain: yes i feel dying :D
12:28 Dove: no, it's just desperate, not death.

12:40 linearain: only a sick mind cant
12:40 Dove: it's fate or desterny

12:47 linearain: ok thanks for all the advice
12:47 linearain: i will turn off pc and phone for a week now
12:47 Dove: the most important thing i learned is the world is far beyond my little thoughts.
12:48 linearain: definitely...
12:48 linearain: we trap ourselves in a small world
12:49 Dove: so know yourself from your past choices, do what u really want, find harmony, and u will be cured.
