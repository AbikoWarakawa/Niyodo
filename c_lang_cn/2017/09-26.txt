12:31 sottd: 华为的sdk开发就是个大傻逼，要求把服务器端用来验证支付合法性的key用在客户端
12:31 sottd: 还在边上写上注释：浮标密钥，CP必须存储在服务端，然后通过安全网络（如https）获取下来，存储到内存中，否则存在私钥泄露风险
12:31 sottd: 他妈的内存里就安全了？
12:54 StardustX: 浮标密钥是什么？没听说过
12:56 sottd: 就当做这个密钥泄露以后玩家可以免费充值的东西吧
12:57 StardustX: 噗，把服务端用的私钥放在用户内存里？
12:57 sottd: 是啊,有点经验的人怎么也能弄到这东西了
12:57 sottd: 更加可怕的事情是
