11:53 lh_ideapad: matchray, do you have any ideas on https://github.com/lhmouse/mcfgthread/issues/21#issuecomment-289288022 ?
11:54 lh_ideapad: the mingw-w64   winpthreads  implementation is more broken than that. (see the link in the OP.)
11:54 lh_ideapad: https://sourceforge.net/p/mingw-w64/bugs/597/
11:56 matchray: i think you meant lldb, not lld
11:56 matchray: oh
11:56 matchray: it is lld!

12:04 lh_ideapad: additional  *
12:04 lh_ideapad:                    https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/XpbsFvQs7D/

12:09 matchray: https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/Copyright-Papers.html
12:09 matchray: you have done this?
12:46 lh_mouse: matchray, the patch for MCF thread model has not been merged to gcc so it is irrelevant.
12:46 lh_mouse: But yes, I have had the copyright assignment pater, albeit for another patch.
12:48 matchray: WoW i probably should do this if i want to contribute to emacs
