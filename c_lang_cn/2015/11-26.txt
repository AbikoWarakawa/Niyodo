12:14 hope1: 你最近在搞什么？
12:14 Dove: 搞仙剑奇侠传
12:14 Dove: 我打算改行了
12:14 Dove: 学会计去，简单点。

12:16 Dove: 嗯
12:16 Dove: 我是很想学计算姬但是我似乎不适合干这个。

12:17 Dove: 到美利坚搞计算姬很有前途嘛，你加油。
12:17 hope1: 没这个说法，除非你急着找工作
12:18 Dove: 我是有点急，计算姬可以当作兴趣慢慢搞。
12:18 hope1: 计算机又没有什么资格之类的东西
12:19 Dove: 会计很多，不过我不打算考。关键是计算姬我什么都不会。
12:19 x-iyzsong: 什么都搞不动啊 :-
12:19 hope1: 那就学咯，计算机自学起来应该是比较方便的
12:19 Dove: x-iyzsong: 卖萌可耻。
12:19 Dove: 嗯，有空就学点。
12:21 Dove: 我也好想去美利坚，好后悔当初没有去啊。

12:32 Dove: 家里人一心就想让我去当会计我也是醉了。
12:32 Dove: x-iyzsong: 是，开饭馆确实很累。
12:33 hope1: 不过开店估计没多少自己的时间
12:33 Dove: 是的
12:35 Dove: 要是能到美利坚过两年别的不说只是练练英语也是好的。
12:35 hope1: 会计呢，会很忙吗
12:36 Dove: 会计很闲很轻松。
12:36 hope1: 不过我觉得还是得自己决定，听家里人其实意义不大
12:36 Dove: 家里人就看中这点，很好混的小会计。
12:36 Dove: 家里人不同意我没本钱开店啊。
12:37 Dove: 小会计混好点做做代账月入也能上万吧
12:37 hope1: 但其他的工作不需要啊
12:38 Dove: 开店也不好，纯粹浪费时间换点钱。
12:39 hope1: 多考虑些不同的出路吧
12:39 Dove: 前一阵子我都想去卖菜
12:39 Dove: 最后忍住了
12:40 x-iyzsong: 感觉要坑 是我就还去搞软件/互联网 不是开发也好
12:40 hope1: 不必这样……
12:42 x-iyzsong: 去北京、上海、杭州都行啊 还可以约约约~
12:43 hope1: 同意
12:44 hope1: 软件相关工作的要求没有你想的那么高
12:46 Dove: 是嘛，我没什么自信啊。
12:46 x-iyzsong: 不过好像搞啥都行(主要是我其他的更不敢去试..) = =
12:46 Dove: 总之先学点会计吧，技多不压身。
12:49 x-iyzsong: olz
12:50 Dove: 会计入门很简单的，就是做个账，平了就行。虽说好像要学精也不容易。
